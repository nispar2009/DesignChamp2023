# DesignChamp2023
My project for the 2023 Design Championship.
When not logged in, users only have read access. In the questionnaire located in the bookmark at the bottom, they can choose the criteria for filtering the quotes, and after the JS script analyzes their preference, it returns certain relevant quotes inside a beautiful card with a doodle for a background.
Behind the scenes, once the admin logs in, they can see two new options on the navbarâ€”Admin and Sign out. The admin option lets the user add new categories and quotes, or change the password. From here, the admin can see all the quotes in the database.
My app uses flask for integrating Python with HTML, and pyodbc to connect with the server.
The credit for the home page doodle goes to valeriya_dor/Adobe Stock.
